# H1 Automatic Scoresheet for Competitve Chess Sets
In competitive chess a scoresheet is notated by both players so tournament officials can rectify any disputes.
Included is a full system schematic as well as the code required by an Arduino Mega 2560 and a computer.

The Arduino Mega must be plugged in via USB to the computer for the system to operate. Then the computer 
software can be run. A webpage opens up with a template chess score sheet on it. 
Chess pieces must have magnets installed on the bottom and be arranged in the starting position before plugging
in the arduino board. 
The system allows two players to focus soley on playing chess, as their moves are automatically recorded
and able to be viewed by an arbiter on the connected computer. The final scoresheet can be
printed out by the arbiter via any connected printer for tournament purposes.
